    <b>Farming techniques</b>
    <p>Subsistence farming focuses on growing food primarily for a family's needs, using simple tools and traditional methods like manual labor and crop rotation. Commercial farming aims for profit by growing crops and livestock on a large scale for sale, utilizing advanced machinery and technology to maximize yield and efficiency. Home farming encompasses techniques like container farming and vertical farming, which allow individuals to cultivate food in limited spaces, often using modern methods to produce food for personal use or small local markets.

<b>Greenhouse Farming</b>
<p>Greenhouse farming is a method of cultivation within sheltered, transparent structures (greenhouses) that control environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and light to optimize plant growth and yield. This Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) allows for year-round production, improved crop quality, increased yields, better pest and disease management, and efficient resource use, even in unfavorable climates. It is a versatile system suitable for high-value crops such as vegetables and flowers, leveraging modern technology for sustainable food production

<b>Aquaculture</b>
<p>Aquaculture, or fish farming, is the controlled breeding, rearing, and harvesting of aquatic organisms like fish, shellfish, and plants, primarily for human consumption. It is the world's fastest-growing food production sector and a crucial method for meeting global food demand as wild fish stocks decline. Practices include raising organisms in tanks, ponds, or offshore cages and controlling factors like feeding and predator protection to ensure growth and survival.

<b>Cattle Farming</b>
<p>Cattle farming is the practice of raising cows, bulls, and oxen mainly for milk, meat, hides, and agricultural work, and it plays a vital role in rural livelihoods by providing not only dairy products and nutrition but also manure for fields and draught power for farming. It requires proper care in terms of breeding, feeding, housing, and health management to maintain high productivity and healthy livestock, and different breeds are often chosen depending on whether the focus is on milk, meat, or both. This farming system continues to be an important part of the agricultural economy, supporting both food production and farmersâ€™ income.</p>
